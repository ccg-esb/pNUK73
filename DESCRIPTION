Title: A Metropolis-Hastings MCMC implementation that fits a simple Monod model to a bacterial growth curve
Description: pNUK73 provides a simple Metropolis-Hastings MCMC method to estimate growth 
	kinetic parameters (mu, Ks, rho) that fit growth curves measured as bacterial optical densities. 
	It also implements a data cloning algorithm [Lele et al. (2007), Lele et al. (2010)] to assess 
	the identifiability of the parameters.
